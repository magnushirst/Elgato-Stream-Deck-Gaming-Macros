Not sure if it's worth creating a config file so the volume increment values and default program for VOIP can be changed easily (Discord/Skype/TS/Hangouts/Curse)

Maybe there should be a shortcut for all of them and it's down to the user to implement whatever shortcuts on their keyboard/macro-board...


If there are problems with AHK, check https://autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm

How do I put my hotkeys and hotstrings into effect automatically every time I start my PC?

There is a folder in the Start Menu called Startup. If you put a shortcut to your script in that folder, the script will launch automatically every time you start your PC. To create a shortcut:

Find the script file, select it, and press Control-C.
Right-click the Start button (typically at the lower left corner of the screen) and choose "Explore All Users".
Navigate to the Startup folder inside the Programs folder.
From the menu bar, choose Edit -> Paste Shortcut. The shortcut to the script should now be in the Startup folder.
```
